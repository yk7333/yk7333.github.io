I am currently a second-year master's student at Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, affiliated with the Intelligent Computing Lab. My supervisor is Prof.  [Xiu Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Xrh1OIUAAAAJ&hl=en), and I have received a lot of research guidance from my senior fellow student [Jiafei Lyu](https://dmksjfl.github.io/). My main research focus on Reinforcement Learning, especially on Agent Exploration, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and RLHF of Large Models. Currently, I am undertaking an internship at Tencent Technology Engineering Group, Machine Learning Platform Department, researching the effective fine-tuning of Large Language Models using RLHF.

I have not yet decided on my future direction. If you believe I am a good fit for your position or would consider me for a PhD program, please don't hesitate to contact me at yk22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn.

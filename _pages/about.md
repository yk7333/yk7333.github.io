I'm currently a researcher of the Tencent Hunyuan X team, focusing on RL and LLM. I hold a degree in Artificial Intelligence from Tsinghua University in 2025. My supervisor is Prof. [Xiu Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Xrh1OIUAAAAJ&hl=en), and I have received a lot of research guidance from my senior fellow student [Jiafei Lyu](https://dmksjfl.github.io/). My main research focus on **Reinforcement Learning**, especially on **LLM post-training**, **RL Exploration**, **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**, etc. I am proficient and interested in using mathematical theory to optimize LLM and RL methods.

If you are interested in connecting with me or believe there is potential for collaboration, please feel free to reach out via email at [yangkaisigsrl@gmail.com](mailto:yangkaisigsrl@gmail.com).

I am currently a second-year master's student at Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, affiliated with the Intelligent Computing Lab. My supervisor is Prof. [Xiu Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Xrh1OIUAAAAJ&hl=en), and I have received a lot of research guidance from my senior fellow student [Jiafei Lyu](https://dmksjfl.github.io/). My main research focus on **Reinforcement Learning**, especially on **Agent Exploration**, **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning** and **RLHF** of Large Models. I am proficient and interested in using mathematical theory to optimize reinforcement learning methods.

If you believe I am a good fit for your position, please don't hesitate to contact me at [yk22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn](mailto:yk22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn).
